# This script forces apps into Homebrew management that were initially installed by other means and thereby were not properly and fully brought into Homebrew. It batch removes unmanaged binaries (preserving user data) and then force re-installs the apps.

# We identify "incomplete/incorrect" installations by checking if `brew list --cask --versions <cask_name>` returns an exit code of 1. This indicates that while the app might exist on disk (e.g. in /Applications), Homebrew does not have a registered receipt or version metadata for it, meaning it cannot manage updates or uninstalls.
