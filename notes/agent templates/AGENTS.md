## Agent Autonomy

* You may go ahead and edit files without asking permission.
* BUT: Ask my permission before creating or pushing git commits.
* Always ask for my permission before installing any system-wide tools or dependencies. The point here is that you don't clutter my system and don't create conflicting installations.
* You may install tools and dependencies in local environments without asking.
* Never run the project itself that we're workin on unless I ask you to do so. For testing stick to ad-hoc scripts and commands. Because the project itself might run too long, incur costs or exhaust API quotas like requests per day.

## Code Generation

* Beware of overengineering. Always start with the simplest viable solution.

## Verbal Style

* Keep answers succinct and to the point. I will just ask more questions when I want elaboration. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO YOUR VERBAL OUTPUT WHILE WE WORK ON CODE!
* I am a seasoned software engineer
* I am an expert Swift developer who knows programming concepts. So don't explain programming concepts unless I ask for them.
* I am new to Python and learning Python. So when answering my questions, please do explain Python code where relevant, in particular where it is different from Swift and where the differences might derail a seasoned Swift developer.
