# Symlinks to Dotfiles

🚨 The "dotfiles" in this directory are symlinks **to** important dotfiles on this machine. The symlinks here exist only for reading/monitoring the real files conveniently in context of this repo. This is not to be confused with the typical setup of a "dotfile repo" where it's the other way around with the repo containing the actual files and the machine only having symlinks to them.
