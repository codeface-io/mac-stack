# This script enforces the philosophy that every Homebrew package used must be declared explicitly in the Brewfile.

# It uninstalls:
# 1) brew packages that are not (yet) declared in the Brewfile
# 2) brew packages that are orphaned dependencies (Orphaned means they were once installed as dependencies but are not depended upon anymore. Brew intentionally tracks and keeps such orphans.)
# 3) unused old package versions, caches
# 4) Cask installers. This disables offline reinstalls (virtually never needed) but frees up a lot of disk space.

# Prepare
set -e  # Exit on any error
BREWFILE_PATH="$(realpath "$(dirname "$0")")/Brewfile"

# Ask for confirmation
echo "⚠️  This will uninstall all brew packages that are not declared in this Brewfile:\n   file://${BREWFILE_PATH// /%20}"
read "response?❓ Continue? (y/N): "
if [[ "$response" != [yY] ]]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Proceed with uninstallations
