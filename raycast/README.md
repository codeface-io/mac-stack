# Raycast

[Raycast](https://raycast.com/) has emerged as THE productivity helper for macOS, being highly customizable and covering **all imaginable conveniences** that macOS is glaringly missing, including global hot keys, a functioning emoji picker, window management, and clipboard history.

## Setup

* To set up Raycast on a new machine without a paid Raycast Pro account, the easiest way is to export/import Raycast settings.
   - Raycast Settings → Advanced → Import / Export
* So whenever you changed Raycast settings, remember to export them. This creates a password protected `.rayconfig` file. Store the file somewhere independent (in the cloud). And store the password somewhere secure (password manager).
* Then on a new or additional machine, import your Raycast settings from your `.rayconfig` file using the corresponding password.

## Global Hot Keys

* These can be set up in Raycast
* If you have apps in non-standard locations, tell Raycast about it: Raycast Settings → Extension → + → Add Application Directory → select additional directory, for example the Desktop
