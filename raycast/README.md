# Raycast

[Raycast](https://raycast.com/) has emerged as THE productivity helper for macOS, being highly customizable, extensible and covering **all imaginable conveniences** that macOS glaringly lacks, including global hot keys, a functioning emoji picker, window management, and clipboard history.

## Setup

* To set up Raycast on a new machine without a paid Raycast Pro account, the easiest way is to export/import Raycast settings.
* So whenever you changed Raycast settings, remember to export them (Raycast Settings → Advanced → Export). This creates a password protected `.rayconfig` file. Store the file somewhere independent (like in your copy/fork of this repo). And store the password somewhere secure (password manager).
* Then on a new or additional machine, import your Raycast settings from your `.rayconfig` file using the corresponding password. Before that, ensure the scripts are already in the expected location:
   1. Copy the scripts from [`scripts`](./scripts) to `~/.config/raycast/scripts`
   2. Raycast Settings → Advanced → Import

## Global Hot Keys

* These can be set up in Raycast
* If you have apps in non-standard locations, tell Raycast about it: Raycast Settings → Extension → + → Add Application Directory → select additional directory, for example the Desktop

### My Setup

It makes sense to build global navigation hot keys around the option key. The option key does typically not interfere with the short cuts of apps (which use the command and control keys) and it already is what brings up raycast (option + space).
