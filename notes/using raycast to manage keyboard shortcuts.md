### how does Raycast manage may Raycast configuration and settings? can it sync all my settings and shortcuts via iCloud? or via a Raycast account? or could I configure raycast via command line and thereby write a script that configures my Raycast?

Yes, you can use `defaults write` to manipulate specific settings stored in Raycast's plist file (`~/Library/Preferences/com.raycast.macos.plist`) without overwriting the entire configuration. This command allows targeted changes to individual keys (e.g., `defaults write com.raycast.macos SomeKey -string "NewValue"`), so you can add or update values while preserving existing ones. However, this only covers basic app preferences‚Äîextension shortcuts (hotkeys) and other user data like quicklinks, snippets, and favorites are **not** stored in the plist.

Those are kept in files under `~/Library/Application Support/com.raycast.macos/`, which includes subfolders for extensions, store data, and potentially JSON or other structured files holding custom configurations. To automate setting up shortcuts without overwriting an existing setup, you'd need a custom script (e.g., in Bash or Python) to:
- Parse the relevant files (likely JSON-based for user overrides).
- Check for existing shortcuts.
- Add or merge your desired ones if they don't conflict or exist.
- Write the updated files back.

This approach isn't officially supported and requires inspecting the folder's contents to identify the exact files (e.g., config.json or similar in subdirectories). Backing up the folder first is recommended to avoid issues. For a full non-Pro sync alternative, some users automate backups of this folder using tools like Hazel or Automator, then selectively merge on another machine.

### so for automating setting up the raycast shortcuts without paying for raycast pro, while not overwriting possibly existing raycast setup, we would manipulate raycast's own settings via `defaults write`?
